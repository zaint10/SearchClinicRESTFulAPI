Create one RESTful API endpoint to allow search in multiple clinic providers and display results from all the available clinics by any of the following:

- Clinic Name
 - State [ex: "CA" or "California"]
- Availability [ex: from:09:00, to:20:00]

This is including search by multiple criteria in the same time like search by state and availability together.
